# Spring Boot Project: User-Booking-Donor-Role Relations

## Overview

This Spring Boot project demonstrates the implementation of a web application with user authentication, booking management, donor registration, and role-based access control. The project showcases the use of Java Persistence API (JPA) for managing entity relationships, along with topics like JPQL, relations, and Criteria Builder.

## Features

- **User Management:** Register users, manage user details, and enforce role-based access control.
  
- **Booking System:** Implement a booking system where users can create and manage bookings.

- **Donor Registration:** Allow users to register as donors, manage donor details, and track donation history.

- **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC):** Utilize roles to control access to different parts of the application.

## Technologies Used

- **Spring Boot:** A powerful and convention-over-configuration based framework for Java applications.

- **Spring Data JPA:** Simplifies database access and manipulation using the Java Persistence API.

- **MySQL Database:** A robust relational database management system.

- **Gradle:** A powerful build tool for managing dependencies and building projects.

## Topics Covered

- **Entity Relationships:** Explore and implement one-to-one, one-to-many, and many-to-many relationships between entities.

- **JPQL (Java Persistence Query Language):** Create custom queries for fetching and manipulating data.

- **Criteria Builder:** Use the Criteria API to dynamically build queries based on runtime conditions.

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/MuhammadIbrahimAlvi/Spring-Data-JPA`

2. Navigate to the project directory: `cd your-repo`

3. Configure MySQL database settings in `application.properties` or `application.yml`.

4. Run the application: `./gradlew bootRun` (or use your IDE's run configuration)

5. Open your browser and visit [http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080)
